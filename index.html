							<h2>2 September - Adobe XD</h2>
							<p> Entry #1 I have began my design for my BOOM ROOM Music streaming room / application website. I have done some research into similar websites and how the user interacts with the interface. After doing some research and learning how to create a working prototype I have decided that im going to use Adobe XD to create my application prototype. This will be a good tool as it is a really good workspace for visualizing how your prototype works and functions for the user. I am going to begin experimenting with this workspace and begin creating my prototype.
							</p>
								<h2>4 September - Working Music Player </h2>
							<p> Entry #2 After doing some research into prototyping on adobe xd, if finally found a video that shows how to effectivley use an embedded media player. Within my "Your Tracks" section of my prototype I will include a field where the user can listen to songs that they have worked on to show and present to the other user within the listening party. This section will demonstrate how the user can collaborate and show case there work to then be dissected in the workspace section within the prototype.

							<h2>18 September - Prototype Design Process</h2>
							<p>Entry #6 I've completed all my design slides for my prototype. I have also began adding my songs to the "Your Tracks" Section as well as adding slide transitions into the application. These interactions include the use of buttons that take you back to the main home page, the type here function displays text when you drag your cursor over it to click. Also adding changing text for when the user selects a different song under the your tracks section. All sounds and music within this prototype have been sourced from https://www.bensound.com/. I've completed the bulk of my prototype, im up to polishing and refining my design so that all the slides look cohesive and professional</p>

							<h2>22 September - Reflection</h2>
							<p>With the resources and time that I've had, I strongly believe that I have successfully created my prototype BOOM ROOM. Developing this brand has taught me more about HTML and the process of trial and error. This problem has been a long withstanding issue within the music industry which has finally been revived. Below is a video of the working prototype taking the user through the process of the application and how to navigate it. This helpful resources will be able to connect people together and help them collaborate there musical talents to create new bodys of work to share the world. </p>
